#Steps to MVP
purchase domain(s)
Point it at glitch project
Direct Urbit notebook/Studio site to it
Landscape:
grass and circles to display centered with width and height equal to the height of the viewport and repeat on left and right to fill screen
Add buttons (Episodes, About, Merch, After Dark) -Cursor changes to pointer finger on hover -Clicking Episodes: load Urbit notebook -Clicking About: does not load a new page but instead hides buttons and instead shows a square or something with the About info, and an X or back button. -Clicking Merch: Merch button vibrates/shakes and it says "coming soon" -Clicking After Dark: Same as clicking the About button, but gives info on the Premium features and includes a link to Urbit page. Also should switch the circles/frame/grass images to the After Dark ones

Nice to have but not necessary for MVP
Somehow set up separate dev environment where code can be tried out but it doesn't affect the site that a user would visit.
Would then need a way to push to live site
Current: make an official dev remix
long term: migrate from glitch; use git
